# Project #0: Traffic Animation

* Author: Alex Acevedo

## Overview

This Java application animates a pair of fire balls being shot from cannons
that are traveling across water and over a bridge when a character is waiting
to cross. 

## Compiling and Using

In order to compile the code the user must do the following commands 
in the main project directory:
`````
$ java TrafficAnimation.java
`````
To run the compiled code, the user must enter the following:
`````
$ java TrafficAnimation

The code does not require any user input, but rather just witness the animation
as it occurs across the screen.  The user can resize the screen and all objects
will resize accordingly.

## Sources used

The sources I used for this program was images from the internet.  .PNG files
to be exact.  I also used the Java Foundations book to help with draw functions.
I used hajsoftutorial.com to help with picking a font to use for my drawString function.
